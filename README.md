# PhishAlyzer
PhishAlyzer is an advanced phishing detection application designed to identify potentially malicious URLs and safeguard users from phishing attacks. Built with an intuitive GUI using Streamlit, this app leverages machine learning to analyse URL features and predict their legitimacy. 
Inspiration 💡 Phishing attacks are a persistent and growing threat in the digital world, targeting unsuspecting users by masquerading as legitimate entities to steal sensitive data. Despite various detection mechanisms, cybercriminals continue to innovate, necessitating a robust and adaptive approach to counter these attacks.

Key Insights: Over 48% of emails sent in 2022 were spam, with an estimated 3.4 billion spam emails sent daily. Phishing attacks resulted in $44.2 million in losses globally in 2021, with each attack costing victims an average of $136. PhishAlyzer aims to combat these issues by leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms for accurate phishing website detection.

Problem Statement 🛡️ Phishing websites significantly threaten user safety, undermining their trust and security in online interactions. Existing detection systems often struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving phishing tactics, highlighting the need for:

Enhanced feature engineering to identify phishing characteristics effectively. Deployment of advanced machine learning models to achieve accurate classification. A user-friendly platform to empower users in staying secure online. PhishAlyzer addresses these challenges with a state-of-the-art detection system.
